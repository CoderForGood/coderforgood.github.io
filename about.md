# About

This project is dedicated to all of the software development engineers who are taken advantage of because they didn't know their rights.

By working together, We can build a better future, for all of us.

I want to build that future. Will [you help us, please?](https://github.com/CoderForGood/coderforgood.github.io)

# Important Legal Note

Most of the people working on this project will not be lawyers, so you should assume that nobody working on this is an actual lawyer in any way, unless they have the credentials and explicitly call themselves out as explicitly being an actual lawyer who is registered in their state. In fact, please assume none of us are lawyers. That is just easier. No lawyers work on this, ok?

The rest of us are are just going to be random people from the Internet with an interest in software and fair hiring practices.

We also acknowledge that a lawyer can work in a state they're not registered in by working "pro hac vice" if the court allows it. But we also acknowledge that this concept - and the related legal education needed to gain this knowledge without reading this page first - is simply too advanced for most individuals as they would not be unaffected or unchanged by surviving a class on Torts, and so we intentionally attempt to stay away from such concepts here in order to not confuse people in our attempt to simplify the search for data on individual rights, as we are NOT giving out legal advice in any way, mearly instead showing links to the law itself, while formatting the available data in a way that is more easily discoverable by the blind or others who simply might have accessibility issues that keep them from being able to freely search for this information in other ways without this community led support and accommodation.

This project was created as a public service with no profit motive. 

All links in this project should link to public resources and Government websites that do not ask for a specific service provider or cost any money to access.

This was created to help people find enjoyable and self sustaining work at companies that will not abuse them or do them harm. As a result, we have intentionally simplified things and kept some data out of this document simply to try to keep to the ideal that we should not present ourselves as lawyers when we are not. As such, We have limited our own opinion greatly in an effort to be fair and balanced, while maintaining a data driven curiosity to find the truth.

Still, you might find opinion here. But thats what it is, opinion. Let us know if you find it so we can clean it up.

That stated, You should speak with a lawyer and get legal counsel for your state and country before sueing or reporting companies for any abuse you feel they might do, as false reports are taken very Very seriously by the people involved, and we ourselves do not promote them in any way. In fact, We accept absolutely no liability whatsoever in any way, shape or form for what you do after reading this. And that has always been true.

However, if you do not have these options available to you, it is our hope that these reference links will provide you a path to do your own research, and make sure that you have online links available to to share with others as a way to educate and defend yourself from unjust abuse by others who seek to violate the rights your state has chosen for themselves.

Please protect your ability to report people for doing bad things, and make sure that you try to understand everything as much as possible, before acting in a manner that we would consider to be dumb, foolish, or against our good intent to help others with less access to these resources.
