# NewJersey

New Jersey does not have a legitimate tech or staffing industry, as far as we are currently aware.

# Note

Opinion: It's generally in your best interest to avoid New Jersey if you work in Tech.

# Warning about International Phone Relays
Treat New Jersey area codes with deep suspicion as they are often used for fruad and identity theft.

New Jersey is known as a place where a lot international PBX phone relays are used to make the owners look like domestic american companies. This type of Misrepresentation is actively illegal in most states, but they do it anyway because they are threat actors who are choosing NJ because NJ allows it when nobody else does.

These same relays are also used by scammers and con-artists based on our research and experience.

Make sure you protect yourself from the worst NJ has to offer.

NJ has a law against companies asking for or accessing your socia media. That law is at [https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu](https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu)

# NJ WARN Act

The New Jersey has a business closing/mass layoff notification law (i.e., New Jersey’s mini-WARN Act), known
officially as the “Millville Dallas Airmotive Plant Job Loss Notification Act,”. You can find that law at [https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu](https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu). The state act affords fewer exemptions to notice delays than does the federal WARN Act, and damages can be far steeper.

# NJ WAGEs MUST BE FULLY PAID WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS
No employer may withhold or divert any portion of an employee’s wages unless the employer is required or
empowered to do so by New Jersey or federal law or unless the amounts withheld or diverted are pursuant to one of
the specifically enumerated reasons set forth in New Jersey’s Wage Payment Law at [https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu](https://lis.njleg.state.nj.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=Publish:10.1048/Enu). This basically means they have to get your signature to be able to do this. So if you don't accept it, then they can't legally do it.
