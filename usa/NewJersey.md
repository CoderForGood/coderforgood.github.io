# NewJersey

New Jersey does not have a legitimate tech or staffing industry, as far as we are currently aware.

# Note

Opinion: It's generally in your best interest to avoid New Jersey if you work in Tech.

# Warning about International Phone Relays
Treat New Jersey area codes with deep suspicion as they are often used for fruad and identity theft.

New Jersey is known as a place where a lot international PBX phone relays are used to make the owners look like domestic american companies. This type of Misrepresentation is actively illegal in most states, but they do it anyway because they are threat actors who are choosing NJ because NJ allows it when nobody else does.

These same relays are also used by scammers and con-artists based on our research and experience.

So if you get a call from New Jersey about a tech job, it's probably not a real job. It's probably just an identity theft scam. Make sure you protect yourself.
