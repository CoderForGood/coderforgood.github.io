# Washington is a great state for Software Engineers to Live and Work.

Washington state is a very good state for software development engineers to live in and work from.


# Washington state has a thriving tech hub.
Washington state also sees growing its own tech sector as part of its own growth.

This is largely in part because of the large tech hub composed of the Seattle, Tacoma, and Redmond Triangle, As the state has learned over time that it is in its own best interests to promote the fair hiring of software engineers to assure healthy tech companies that employ them fairly and ethically, in a sustainable way.

## Washington state is a two party consent state.

Washington law makes it explicitly illegal to record others without their consent, except in a few security specific cases that are generally not relevant for employment law. You can find that law at [https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=9.73.030)

## Washington state makes it illegal to lie - even by ommission - if you work in recruiting, staffing, or HR.

It is explicity illegal for any "Labor Agent" (Thats *anybody* in HR or hiring/staffing/recruiting roles of any kind, including sourcing or third parties) to lie, misrepresent, or intentionally hide data about a job as in WA state as its considerd to be a form of fruad so much that the law itself uses that explicit word in its title, and you can find that law at [https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.44.050](https://app.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.44.050).

So if you feel like you've been bait and switched, and you're in Washington state, then chances are that law might have been (and probably was, in our humble opinion) violated.

## Washington state has a strict pay transparency law that is in effect in *any* online post or communication.

Washington state is one of many that has a pay transparency law, and you can find WA's at [https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.58.110](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=49.58.110) where it explicitly states that it applies to any form of online communication or recruitment. This means that if they reach out to you online, it doesn't matter where they are from, or who they claim to represent, if they reach out to you online, or over a phone, under this law they MUST answer these questions and not doing so is explicitly illegal. It also explicitly requires a good faith pay range be placed on every posted job description, even if the job description goes online. If the job description is missing this criticalty mandated good faith pay range data, then you have the legal right under this law to request that data, and get it, immediattly, without delay, as a response.

## Washington state has effectivly (but not explicitly) made offshore recruiters contacting you to be illegal.

Under the new pay transparency law that started as of 1/1/2023, it is not legal for a recruiter or staffing agent to not give you that title, company, or wage data when you request it, so after they first violate the law by not presenting that data the first time they contact you, by not giving you the data you requested in response to that, they are now breaking the law again.

So this is the law that has made offshore recruiters contacting people in Washington state to be fully illegal, because offshore recruiters based out of India or South America for example can't legally comply with the WA state law that mandated they tell the person they're talking to what company they would be working for, what the job description would be, and how much they would be paid, as is required by that law, so because their business model intentionally requires a lack of transparency that Intentionally violates the pay transparency law of Washington state, they may not oppoerate in Washington state.

As a result of not working with the hiring manager directly, they just wont have the information they are legally required to present to candidates when they contact them. And as a result, these offshore companies are not legally allowed to operate within Washington, because doing so violates the pay transparency law when the hiring agent does not have this data to present to the candidate.

## Washington state makes it explicitly illegal for companies to ask for or access your social media.

Washington state has explicitly made it illegal for employers to ask to access your social media. It doesn't matter what the company wants to claim. There is no such thing as a company policy that allows this. You can find that law at [https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.44.200](https://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=49.44.2000) Where it explicitly states that they cannot ask you to edit/remove/add posts, or even access your posts.And if they ask for your social media password, that is also explicitly illegal. If your boss accesses your social media without your consent, or steals your password, talk to a lawyer.

## Notes

Intelligent readers will notice that many of these laws leverage RCW 49.44.050, and that is intentional. This law that makes misrepresentation illegal has been on the books in WA since the 1970s, and is very settled law as far as is currently understood.
