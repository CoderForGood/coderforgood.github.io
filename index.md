## Welcome to our GitHub.io page.

It's saddly often the case that people with agendas against democracy like to take advantage of software engineers.  

This project aims to educate people on their rights in the labor market by providing the forbidden knowledge that is intentionally being kept from them by others in order to assure that they can be taken advabtage of due to thier ignorance.

The explicit goal of this project is to give you the reader the knowledge and data you need to fight back against the unprofessional and illegitimate companies that intentionally seek to abuse or violate the law in order to harm the software development community with abusive labor practices.

And we need your help, because not all of us live in the same area, or know the same things. Contribute what you know and provide links so that you can help others.

### Mermaid?

This project leverages mermaid JS diagrams.  The intention of this is to allow a visual element that the authors can easily access and change in source control.
